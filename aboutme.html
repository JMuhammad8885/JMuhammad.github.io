<h2>So much technology, so little talent. <em>-Venor Vinge</em></h2>

<p>
	My name is Jelani Muhammad and I'm a inspiring web developer. For the past 5 years I have worked in the beer industry as a brewery work for a company called Millercoors. Working in a manufacturing field I have seen the effects of new technology in the work force. So switching careers to stay infront of this technology wave was the best thing to do. My goal is to learn everything possible to become a great web developer and to create high quality work for my customers.
